Tools added:
1. Picasso
2. Rxjava
3. Repository pattern
4. MVVM
5. Unit testing
6. Splash Screen

Suggestions:
1. Landscape view with master detail layout
2. Instrumentation test with espresso

Assumptions
1. I assumed to have real mock screen designs of  what the layout should look  like
   (preferably from UX/UI engineers) to increase user experience and retention
2. I assumed no caching was needed as this is an app that would always require network calls to get checkout items,
   and perform checkout functions
3. Returning to the checkout screen clears user's invoice
